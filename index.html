						<h2>Founder and Lead Developer</h2>
						<p>Developed an algorithm that analyzed a user's outfit to provide suggestions on and predict future purchases. Built a platform that monitored the several million items for sale online and pushed new items into a user's feed when it potentially matched their style. Algorithm was acquired by an ad-tech company for use in dynamic advertising.</p>

						<div class="right">
							<p>Developed app that allows users to share interesting links they've read with their friends. Uses NLP and a graph database to analyze topics in text content and determing how they relate. This allows interesting search queries like: 'what articles have my friends read about docker' or 'show me all the topics related to reactjs' or 'how does obama relate to syria'</p>

							<p>Analyzes piracy activity across 6 million torrents on a daily basis in an attempt to provide open and transparent data on how movies and tv shows are affected by illegal downloads. Helps content that struggles by traditional Nielsen metrics find a profitable home online by understanding why their audience is pirating, instead of fighting them by trying to pass legislation like SOPA</p>

							<p>Distributed triple store that can run on top of any database. Allows compelex graph queries like "what restaraunts are in my twitter followers' followers current locations" to be expressed as a subset of the Gremlin graph query language. Single queries are optimized into multiple concurrent requests for use in low-latency environments. Also has a full javascript REPL tool for debugging purposes.</p>
