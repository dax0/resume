						<h2>Founder and Lead Developer</h2>
						<p>Developed an algorithm that analyzed a user's outfit to provide suggestions on and predict future purchases. Built a platform that monitored the several million items for sale online and pushed new items into a user's feed when it potentially matched their style. Algorithm was acquired by an ad-tech company for use in dynamic advertising.</p>

						<h2>Lead Developer and Lead Designer</h2>
						<p>Designed interactive ad campaigns for numerous luxury fashion brands with engagement rates 100x above industry standard. Developed 'smart-creatives' that analyzed consumer behavior and automatically transformed to optimize to the current viewer.</p>
